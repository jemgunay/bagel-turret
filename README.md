# Bagel Turret: Remote Surveillance BB Turret
A remotely controllable and viewable BB gun made possible with a Raspberry Pi 3, an old childhood Meccano kit and a cheap automatic BB gun. The mounted Pi hosts a Flask web server which can be remotely accessed to view the turret PiCamera stream and control the motor/servo aiming via a user friendly web app interface.
